%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

Your abstract in English. Keep the abstract short. The abstract explains your

written into the pdf file's metadata. Write here the text that goes into the 
metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph 
break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain 
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of 
the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract 
text must be identical to the text on the abstract page.

%% work. Write here the copyright text you want. It is written into the metadata
%% of the pdf file as well.
%% Syntax:
%% \copyrigthtext{metadata text}{text visible on the page}
%% 
%% In the macro below, the text written in the metadata must have a \noexpand
%% macro before the \copyright special character, and macros (\copyright and
%% \year here) must be separated by the \ character (space chacter) from the
%% text that follows. The macros in the argument of the \copyrighttext macro
%% automatically insert the year and the author's name. (Note! \ThesisAuthor is
%% an internal macro of the aaltothesis.cls class file).
%% Of course, the same text could have simply been written as
%% \copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%% {Copyright \copyright{} 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%%
\copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ \number\year\ \ThesisAuthor}
{Copyright \copyright{} \number\year{} \ThesisAuthor}

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the 
%% metadata to be written into the pdf file) by setting the writexmpdata switch

\subsection*{Problem statement}
In recent years, computer vision algorithms have received much attention due to their potential applications in a vast variety of fields. As the technologies advance, endless possiblities arise in numerous fields, such as security monitoring, medicine and self driving vehicles. \cite{Oza2021} Although over the last decade computer vision has been emerging in indurstial applications, such as safety and process monitoring \cite{Oza2021}, fewer research has addressed the issue of equipment detection. 

Industrial plants typically are hundreds of meters long and often it becomes frustrating to identify minor equipment parts. Identifying the parts becomes relevant once they need replacement or maintenance as the plant would not be able to run at full capacity without them. Ore processing plants treat several hundreds of tons of ore per hour, and the production capacity is constant. \cite{Oza2021}. Therefore, quite often it is troublesome to properly identify the equipment within a list of thousands of various parts in a medium to large scaled plant. 

Although various methods have been implemented for detection of objects in various domains\cite{Oza2021}, these methods require an extensive dataset of images in order to work. In our scenario, the images can easily be collected from the simulator, however, this raises certain restrictions on the accuracy of the models as the models will not perform as well on real images.  

This thesis proposes feasible object detection algorithms as a solution to automatically localize and identify the equipment in a large environment and minimize the delay before the production is online again. 

\subsection*{Thesis objective}
The aim of the thesis is to identify a suitable object detection method for an industrial environment and develop a minimal proof of concept application with user interface. The selected method should be able to identify an object in a real image given a dataset of rendered images from a 3D equipment model.

Additionally, a method should propose a solution to optimize the laborous data collection and labelling process. The optimization is important not only because it is a time demanding process, but also because in large plants there are thousands of objects and scalability is critical. 

\subsection*{Methods}

In order to accomplish the objectives defined, this paper will compare multiple methods for object detection and explore the most recent developments in domain adaptation field. 
For the purpose of training an object detection model, a vast number of training and testing pictures is required. In most traditional object detection algorithms, there is little to no difference in the environment where the training and testing images have been taken. Unfortunately, often the accuracy results  are lower than anticipated, when the phenomenon of domain shift takes place. \cite{Oza2021} Domain shift occurs, for example, when the object of interest is placed under different weather or lighting conditions, such as \cite{Oza2021}.
Additionally, in an industrial environment, it often becomes challenging to take pictures due to accessibility and confidentiality regulations. Therefore, this paper proposes to tackle the challenge by means of domain adaptation, namely Cross Domain Adaptation,  Decoupled Adaptation for Cross Domain Object Detection and Progressive Domain Adaptation for Object Detection. 
The dataset utilized to implement the methods is based on TLess open source dataset\cite{Oza2021} due to limitations in obtaining real life data. Originally the dataset is meant for pose estimation in 3D models, therefore the dataset was converted to formats, appropriate for the proposed methods. 

The methods will be trained on rendered data from 3D models and evaluated on real images using mean average precision metrics. 
Finally, the selected method will be evaluated on one equipment item from a real plant. 

\subsection*{Scope}

The thesis is limited to proposing the solution upon analysing multiple existing state-of-the-art methodologies. Preparing the actual real life dataset and implementing the solution for a real plant remains out of the scope. Although the proposed methods attempt to minimize the data collection and labelling process, it might take multiple months before a model based on the real data is ready for training. 
 
\subsection*{Metso:Outotec}
The issuer and the commissioner of the thesis topic is Metso Outotec Oyj. Metso Outotec is a Finnish publicly traded company that formed as a result of a merger of two companies - Metso Minerals and Outotec on June, 2020. The company provides sustainable solutions and services worldwide for minerals processing, aggregates and metal refining. 

Along with the focus on sustainability and strive for innovation, Metso Outotec aims on digitization throughout the equipment cycle. Therefore, the company offers various IoT solutions that attempt to optimize various production processes for customers. \cite{Oza2021} Naturally, computer vision is of great interest to the company due to its potential in the industry and the proposed thesis topic was reported to be in high demand among the plant owners.

Liitteet eiv\"at ole opinn\"aytteen kannalta v\"altt\"am\"att\"omi\"a ja 
opinn\"aytteen tekij\"an on 
kirjoittamaan ryhtyess\"a\"an hyv\"a ajatella p\"arj\"a\"av\"ans\"a ilman liitteit\"a.
Kokemattomat kirjoittajat, jotka ovat huolissaan
tekstiosan pituudesta, paisuttavat turhan 
helposti liitteit\"a pit\"a\"akseen tekstiosan pituuden annetuissa rajoissa.
T\"all\"a tavalla ei synny hyv\"a\"a opinn\"aytett\"a.   

Liite on itsen\"ainen kokonaisuus, vaikka se t\"aydent\"a\"akin tekstiosaa.
Liite ei siten ole pelkk\"a listaus, kuva tai taulukko, vaan 
liitteess\"a selitet\"a\"an aina sis\"all\"on laatu ja tarkoitus. 

Liitteeseen voi laittaa esimerkiksi listauksia. Alla on 
listausesimerkki t\"am\"an liitteen luomisesta.
