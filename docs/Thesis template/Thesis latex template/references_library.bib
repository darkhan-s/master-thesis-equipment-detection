  abstract      = {Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of accurate and efficient models for various computer vision applications such as classification, segmentation, and detection. However, learning highly accurate models relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Due to this, model performance drops drastically when evaluated on label-scarce datasets having visually distinct images, termed as domain adaptation problem. There is a plethora of works to adapt classification and segmentation models to label-scarce target datasets through unsupervised domain adaptation. Considering that detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, many recent works have focused on developing novel domain adaptive detection techniques. Here, we describe in detail the domain adaptation problem for detection and present an extensive survey of the various methods. Furthermore, we highlight strategies proposed and the associated shortcomings. Subsequently, we identify multiple aspects of the problem that are most promising for future research. We believe that this survey shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, biometrics, medical imaging, and autonomous navigation by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning (DL) based object detection has achieved great progress. These methods typically assume that large amount of labeled training data is available, and training and test data are drawn from an identical distribution. However, the two assumptions are not always hold in practice. Deep domain adaptive object detection (DDAOD) has emerged as a new learning paradigm to address the above mentioned challenges. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art progress on deep domain adaptive object detection approaches. Firstly, we introduce briefly the basic concepts of deep domain adaptation. Secondly, the deep domain adaptive detectors are classified into five categories and detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category are provided. Finally, insights for future research trend are presented.},
