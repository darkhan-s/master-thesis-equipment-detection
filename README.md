## Equipment identification through image recognition 
Darkhan's Master's thesis repository. The project attempts to tackle the challenge of equipment recognition in an industrial environment using rendered images from 3D models

The repo is based on the [Official DETR implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr) and the adaptation methodology is borrowed from [Adaptive Teacher model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/adaptive_teacher). 

Additionally, it is considered to utilize EFL introduced in [EOD](https://github.com/modeltc/eod).
